Chart::Plotly::Trace::Mesh3d

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/mesh3d.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/> 
Open source announcement: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/open-source-announcement/>

Full reference: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#mesh3d>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
	my $self = shift;
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
	my %hash = (%$self, %$extra_args); 
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
	if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
		$hash{type} = $self->type();
	}
	return \%hash;
}

=item * alphahull

Determines how the mesh surface triangles are derived from the set of vertices (points) represented by the `x`, `y` and `z` arrays, if the `i`, `j`, `k` arrays are not supplied. For general use of `mesh3d` it is preferred that `i`, `j`, `k` are supplied. If *-1*, Delaunay triangulation is used, which is mainly suitable if the mesh is a single, more or less layer surface that is perpendicular to `delaunayaxis`. In case the `delaunayaxis` intersects the mesh surface at more than one point it will result triangles that are very long in the dimension of `delaunayaxis`. If *>0*, the alpha-shape algorithm is used. In this case, the positive `alphahull` value signals the use of the alpha-shape algorithm, _and_ its value acts as the parameter for the mesh fitting. If *0*,  the convex-hull algorithm is used. It is suitable for convex bodies or if the intention is to enclose the `x`, `y` and `z` point set into a convex hull.

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in z space, use zmin and zmax

=item * i

A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between 0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing the *first* vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m], j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in the mesh, where `i[m] = n` points to the triplet `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore, each element in `i` represents a point in space, which is the first vertex of a triangle.
