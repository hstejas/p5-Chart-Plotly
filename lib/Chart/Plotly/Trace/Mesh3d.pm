=head1 METHODS

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;

=item * alphahull

Determines how the mesh surface triangles are derived from the set of vertices (points) represented by the `x`, `y` and `z` arrays, if the `i`, `j`, `k` arrays are not supplied. For general use of `mesh3d` it is preferred that `i`, `j`, `k` are supplied. If *-1*, Delaunay triangulation is used, which is mainly suitable if the mesh is a single, more or less layer surface that is perpendicular to `delaunayaxis`. In case the `delaunayaxis` intersects the mesh surface at more than one point it will result triangles that are very long in the dimension of `delaunayaxis`. If *>0*, the alpha-shape algorithm is used. In this case, the positive `alphahull` value signals the use of the alpha-shape algorithm, _and_ its value acts as the parameter for the mesh fitting. If *0*,  the convex-hull algorithm is used. It is suitable for convex bodies or if the intention is to enclose the `x`, `y` and `z` point set into a convex hull.
