Chart::Plotly::Trace::Bar::Marker::Line

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/bar.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace bar.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

=item * autocolorscale

Has an effect only if `marker.line.color` is set to a numerical array. Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by `marker.line.colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the `color` array are all positive, all negative or mixed.

);

=item * cauto

Has an effect only if `marker.line.color` is set to a numerical array and `cmin`, `cmax` are set by the user. In this case, it controls whether the range of colors in `colorscale` is mapped to the range of values in the `color` array (`cauto: true`), or the `cmin`/`cmax` values (`cauto: false`). Defaults to `false` when `cmin`, `cmax` are set by the user.

);

=item * cmax

Has an effect only if `marker.line.color` is set to a numerical array. Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should be associated to the `marker.line.color` array index, and if set, `marker.line.cmin` must be set as well.

=cut

has cmax => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Has an effect only if `marker.line.color` is set to a numerical array. Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should be associated to the `marker.line.color` array index, and if set, `marker.line.cmin` must be set as well.",
);

=item * cmin

Has an effect only if `marker.line.color` is set to a numerical array. Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should be associated to the `marker.line.color` array index, and if set, `marker.line.cmax` must be set as well.

);

=item * color

Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to `cmin` and `cmax` if set.

=cut

has color => (
    is => "rw",

    documentation => "Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to `cmin` and `cmax` if set.",
);

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale and only has an effect if `marker.line.color` is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use `marker.line.cmin` and `marker.line.cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys, YlGnBu, Greens, YlOrRd, Bluered, RdBu, Reds, Blues, Picnic, Rainbow, Portland, Jet, Hot, Blackbody, Earth, Electric, Viridis, Cividis
