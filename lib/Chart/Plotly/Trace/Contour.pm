# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: The data from which contour lines are computed is set in `z`. Data in `z` must be a {2D array} of numbers. Say that `z` has N rows and M columns, then by default, these N rows correspond to N y coordinates (set in `y` or auto-generated) and the M columns correspond to M x coordinates (set in `x` or auto-generated). By setting `transpose` to *true*, the above behavior is flipped.

The data from which contour lines are computed is set in `z`. Data in `z` must be a {2D array} of numbers.

But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {

            }
        }
    }

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the `color` array are all positive, all negative or mixed.

Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * zmid

Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no effect when `zauto` is `false`.
