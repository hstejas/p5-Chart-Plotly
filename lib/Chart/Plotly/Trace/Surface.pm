=head1 NAME 

Chart::Plotly::Trace::Surface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/surface.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The data the describes the coordinates of the surface is set in `z`. Data in `z` should be a {2D array}. Coordinates in `x` and `y` can either be 1D {arrays} or {2D arrays} (e.g. to graph parametric surfaces). If not provided in `x` and `y`, the x and y coordinates are assumed to be linear starting at 0 with a unit step. The color scale corresponds to the `z` values by default. For custom color scales, use `surfacecolor` which should be a {2D array}, where its bounds can be controlled using `cmin` and `cmax`.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;
