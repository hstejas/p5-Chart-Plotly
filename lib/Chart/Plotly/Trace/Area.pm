Chart::Plotly::Trace::Area

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/area.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION



This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/> 
Open source announcement: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/open-source-announcement/>

Full reference: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#area>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;
}

=head2 type

Trace type.

=cut

sub type {
	my @components = split(/::/, __PACKAGE__);
	return lc($components[-1]);
}

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=cut

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=cut

has customdata => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|PDL",
    documentation => "Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements",
);

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=cut

has customdatasrc => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .",
);

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=cut

has hoverinfo => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[ArrayRef]",
    documentation => "Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.",
);

=item * hoverinfosrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

=cut

has hoverinfosrc => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .",
);

=item * hoverlabel


=cut

has hoverlabel => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Area::Hoverlabel",
);

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=cut

has ids => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|PDL",
    documentation => "Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.",
);

=item * idssrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .

=cut

has idssrc => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .",
);

=item * legendgroup

Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.

=cut

has legendgroup => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.",
);

=item * marker


=cut

has marker => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Area::Marker",

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=cut

has name => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.",

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the trace.

=cut

has rsrc => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .",
);

=item * selectedpoints

Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

=cut

has selectedpoints => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Any",
    documentation => "Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
