This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;
}

=head2 type

Trace type.

=cut

sub type {
	my @components = split(/::/, __PACKAGE__);
	return lc($components[-1]);
}

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=cut

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=cut

has customdata => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|PDL",
    documentation => "Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements",

=cut

has hoverinfo => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[ArrayRef]",

=item * ids

Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.

=cut

has ids => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|PDL",
    documentation => "Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type.",

    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",

=item * legendgroup

Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items.

=cut

has legendgroup => (
    is => "rw",

=item * marker


=cut

has marker => (

    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Area::Marker",
);

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=cut

has name => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.",
);

=item * opacity

Sets the opacity of the trace.

=cut

has opacity => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Sets the opacity of the trace.",
);

=item * r

Area traces are deprecated! Please switch to the *barpolar* trace type. Sets the radial coordinates for legacy polar chart only.

=cut

has r => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|PDL",
    documentation => "Area traces are deprecated! Please switch to the *barpolar* trace type. Sets the radial coordinates for legacy polar chart only.",

=item * rsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .

=cut

has rsrc => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .",
);

=item * selectedpoints

Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

=cut

has selectedpoints => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Any",
    documentation => "Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.",
);

=item * showlegend

Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

=cut

has showlegend => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Bool",
    documentation => "Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.",
);

=item * stream


=cut

has stream => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Area::Stream",
);

=item * t

Area traces are deprecated! Please switch to the *barpolar* trace type. Sets the angular coordinates for legacy polar chart only.

=cut

has t => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|PDL",
    documentation => "Area traces are deprecated! Please switch to the *barpolar* trace type. Sets the angular coordinates for legacy polar chart only.",
);

=item * transforms


=cut

has transforms => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|ArrayRef[Chart::Plotly::Trace::Area::Transform]",
);

=item * tsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  t .

=cut

has tsrc => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  t .",
);

=item * uid


=cut

has uid => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
);

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=cut

    documentation => "Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).",
