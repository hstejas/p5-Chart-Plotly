Chart::Plotly::Trace::Scatter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/scatter.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/> 
Open source announcement: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/open-source-announcement/>

Full reference: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#scatter>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
	my $self = shift;
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
	my %hash = (%$self, %$extra_args); 
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
	if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
		$hash{type} = $self->type();
	}
	return \%hash;
}



=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=cut

=item * connectgaps

Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected.

=cut

has connectgaps => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Bool",
    documentation => "Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected.",
);

=item * dx

Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.

=cut

has dx => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.",
);

=item * dy

Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.

=cut

has dy => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.",
);

=item * error_x


=cut

has error_x => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Attribute::Error_x"
);

=item * error_y


=cut

has error_y => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Attribute::Error_y"
);

=item * fill

Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with `fillcolor` if not *none*. *tozerox* and *tozeroy* fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. *tonextx* and *tonexty* fill between the endpoints of this trace and the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave like *tozerox* and *tozeroy*. *toself* connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. *tonext* fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like *toself* if there is no trace before it. *tonext* should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other.

=cut

has fill => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Sets the area to fill with a solid color.

);

=item * fillcolor

Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available.

=cut

has fillcolor => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available.",
);

=item * hoveron

Do the hover effects highlight individual points (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled regions? If the fill is *toself* or *tonext* and there are no markers or text, then the default is *fills*, otherwise it is *points*.

=cut

has hoveron => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Do the hover effects highlight individual points (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled regions? If the fill is *toself* or *tonext* and there are no markers or text, then the default is *fills*, otherwise it is *points*.",

=item * ids

A list of keys for object constancy of data points during animation

=item * mode

Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If the provided `mode` includes *text* then the `text` elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than 20 points, then the default is *lines+markers*. Otherwise, *lines*.

=cut

has mode => (
    is => 'rw',
