# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: The scatterpolargl trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates using the WebGL plotting engine. The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `r` (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Bubble charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to numerical arrays.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The scatterpolargl trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates using the WebGL plotting engine. The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `r` (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Bubble charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to numerical arrays.

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=cut

=item * connectgaps

Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected.

=cut

has connectgaps => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Bool",
    documentation => "Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected.",
);

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=cut

has customdata => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|PDL",
    documentation => "Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements",
);

=item * customdatasrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

=cut

has customdatasrc => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .",
);

=item * dr

Sets the r coordinate step.

=cut

has dr => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Sets the r coordinate step.",
);

=item * dtheta

Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the `dtheta` step equals the subplot's period divided by the length of the `r` coordinates.

=cut

has dtheta => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the `dtheta` step equals the subplot's period divided by the length of the `r` coordinates.",
);

=item * fill

Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to *none* unless this trace is stacked, then it gets *tonexty* (*tonextx*) if `orientation` is *v* (*h*) Use with `fillcolor` if not *none*. *tozerox* and *tozeroy* fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. *tonextx* and *tonexty* fill between the endpoints of this trace and the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave like *tozerox* and *tozeroy*. *toself* connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. *tonext* fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like *toself* if there is no trace before it. *tonext* should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.

Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided.
