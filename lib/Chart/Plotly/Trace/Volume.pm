# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: Draws volume trace between iso-min and iso-max values with coordinates given by four 1-dimensional arrays containing the `value`, `x`, `y` and `z` of every vertex of a uniform or non-uniform 3-D grid. Horizontal or vertical slices, caps as well as spaceframe between iso-min and iso-max values could also be drawn using this trace.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/volume.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Draws volume trace between iso-min and iso-max values with coordinates given by four 1-dimensional arrays containing the `value`, `x`, `y` and `z` of every vertex of a uniform or non-uniform 3-D grid. Horizontal or vertical slices, caps as well as spaceframe between iso-min and iso-max values could also be drawn using this trace.

Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
