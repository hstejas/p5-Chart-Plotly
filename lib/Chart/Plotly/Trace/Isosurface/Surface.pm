# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: This attribute is one of the possible options for the trace isosurface.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/isosurface.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace isosurface.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;
}

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=cut

=item * count

Sets the number of iso-surfaces between minimum and maximum iso-values. By default this value is 2 meaning that only minimum and maximum surfaces would be drawn.

=cut

has count => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Int",
    documentation => "Sets the number of iso-surfaces between minimum and maximum iso-values. By default this value is 2 meaning that only minimum and maximum surfaces would be drawn.",
);

=item * fill

Sets the fill ratio of the iso-surface. The default fill value of the surface is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a `fill` ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges.

=cut

has fill => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Sets the fill ratio of the iso-surface. The default fill value of the surface is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a `fill` ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges.",
);

=item * pattern

Sets the surface pattern of the iso-surface 3-D sections. The default pattern of the surface is `all` meaning that the rest of surface elements would be shaded. The check options (either 1 or 2) could be used to draw half of the squares on the surface. Using various combinations of capital `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and `E` may also be used to reduce the number of triangles on the iso-surfaces and creating other patterns of interest.

=item * show

Hides/displays surfaces between minimum and maximum iso-values.
