=head1 NAME 

Chart::Plotly::Trace::Pointcloud

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/pointcloud.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The data visualized as a point cloud set in `x` and `y` using the WebGl plotting engine.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/> 
Open source announcement: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/open-source-announcement/>

Full reference: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#pointcloud>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;
}

=head2 type

Trace type.

=cut

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * indices

A sequential value, 0..n, supply it to avoid creating this array inside plotting. If specified, it must be a typed `Int32Array` array. Its length must be equal to or greater than the number of points. For the best performance and memory use, create one large `indices` typed array that is guaranteed to be at least as long as the largest number of points during use, and reuse it on each `Plotly.restyle()` call.

=item * text

Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points.
