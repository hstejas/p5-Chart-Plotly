=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use HTML::Show;
	use Chart::Plotly;
	use Chart::Plotly::Trace::Attribute::Lighting;
	my $lighting = Chart::Plotly::Trace::Attribute::Lighting->new(x => [1 .. 5], y => [1 .. 5]);
	
	HTML::Show::show(Chart::Plotly::render_full_html(data => [$lighting]));

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
	my $self = shift; 
	my %hash = %$self; 
	if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
		$hash{type} = $self->type();
	}
	return \%hash;
}



=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=cut

=item * ambient

Ambient light increases overall color visibility but can wash out the image.

=cut

has ambient => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Ambient light increases overall color visibility but can wash out the image.",
);

=item * diffuse

Represents the extent that incident rays are reflected in a range of angles.

=cut

has diffuse => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Represents the extent that incident rays are reflected in a range of angles.",
);

=item * fresnel

Represents the reflectance as a dependency of the viewing angle; e.g. paper is reflective when viewing it from the edge of the paper (almost 90 degrees), causing shine.

=cut

has fresnel => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Represents the reflectance as a dependency of the viewing angle; e.g. paper is reflective when viewing it from the edge of the paper (almost 90 degrees), causing shine.",
);

=item * roughness

Alters specular reflection; the rougher the surface, the wider and less contrasty the shine.

=cut

has roughness => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Alters specular reflection; the rougher the surface, the wider and less contrasty the shine.",
);

=item * specular

Represents the level that incident rays are reflected in a single direction, causing shine.

=cut

has specular => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Represents the level that incident rays are reflected in a single direction, causing shine.",
);

=item * name

Sets the trace name

=cut

has name => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the trace name",
);
