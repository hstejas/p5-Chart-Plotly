=cut

sub TO_JSON {
	my $self = shift; 
	my %hash = %$self; 
	if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
		$hash{type} = $self->type();
	}
	return \%hash;

=item * color

Sets the line color.

has color => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Sets the line color.",
);

=item * dash

Sets the style of the lines. Set to a dash string type or a dash length in px.

=cut

has dash => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the style of the lines. Set to a dash string type or a dash length in px.",
);

=item * shape

Determines the line shape. With *spline* the lines are drawn using spline interpolation. The other available values correspond to step-wise line shapes.

has shape => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Determines the line shape. With *spline* the lines are drawn using spline interpolation. The other available values correspond to step-wise line shapes.",
);

=item * smoothing

Has an effect only if `shape` is set to *spline* Sets the amount of smoothing. *0* corresponds to no smoothing (equivalent to a *linear* shape).

=cut

has smoothing => (
