Chart::Plotly::Trace::Heatmapgl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use HTML::Show;
	use Chart::Plotly;
	use Chart::Plotly::Trace::Heatmapgl;
	my $heatmapgl = Chart::Plotly::Trace::Heatmapgl->new(x => [1 .. 5], y => [1 .. 5]);
	
	HTML::Show::show(Chart::Plotly::render_full_html(data => [$heatmapgl]));


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
	my $self = shift; 
	my %hash = %$self; 
	if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
		$hash{type} = $self->type();
	}
	return \%hash;
}



=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=cut

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether or not the colorscale is picked using the sign of the input z values.

=cut

has autocolorscale => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Bool",
    documentation => "Determines whether or not the colorscale is picked using the sign of the input z values.",
);

=item * colorbar


=cut

has colorbar => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Attribute::Colorbar"
);

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in z space, use zmin and zmax
