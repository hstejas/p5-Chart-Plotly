# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: The candlestick is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close for a given `x` coordinate (most likely time). The boxes represent the spread between the `open` and `close` values and the lines represent the spread between the `low` and `high` values Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing). By default, increasing candles are drawn in green whereas decreasing are drawn in red.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The candlestick is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close for a given `x` coordinate (most likely time). The boxes represent the spread between the `open` and `close` values and the lines represent the spread between the `low` and `high` values Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing). By default, increasing candles are drawn in green whereas decreasing are drawn in red.

But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;
