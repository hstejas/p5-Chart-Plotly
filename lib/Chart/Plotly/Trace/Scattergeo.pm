=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
	my $self = shift; 
	my %hash = %$self; 
	if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
		$hash{type} = $self->type();
	}
	return \%hash;
}



=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=cut

=item * connectgaps

Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected.

=cut

has connectgaps => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Bool",
    documentation => "Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected.",
);

=item * fill

Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with `fillcolor` if not *none*. *toself* connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape.

=cut

has fill => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with `fillcolor` if not *none*. *toself* connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape.",
);

=item * fillcolor

Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available.

=cut

has fillcolor => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available.",
);

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=cut

has hoverinfo => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.",
);

=item * lat

Sets the latitude coordinates (in degrees North).

=cut

has lat => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Sets the latitude coordinates (in degrees North).",
);

=item * line


=cut

has line => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Attribute::Line"
);

=item * locationmode

Determines the set of locations used to match entries in `locations` to regions on the map.

=cut

has locationmode => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Determines the set of locations used to match entries in `locations` to regions on the map.",
);

=item * locations

Sets the coordinates via location IDs or names. Coordinates correspond to the centroid of each location given. See `locationmode` for more info.

=cut

has locations => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Sets the coordinates via location IDs or names. Coordinates correspond to the centroid of each location given. See `locationmode` for more info.",
);

=item * lon

Sets the longitude coordinates (in degrees East).

=cut

has lon => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Sets the longitude coordinates (in degrees East).",
);

=item * marker


=cut

has marker => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Attribute::Marker"
);

=item * mode

Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If the provided `mode` includes *text* then the `text` elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than 20 points, then the default is *lines+markers*. Otherwise, *lines*.

=cut

has mode => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If the provided `mode` includes *text* then the `text` elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than 20 points, then the default is *lines+markers*. Otherwise, *lines*.",
);

=item * text

Sets text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair or item in `locations`. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (lon,lat) or `locations` coordinates.

=cut

has text => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Maybe[ArrayRef]|Str",
    documentation => "Sets text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair or item in `locations`. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (lon,lat) or `locations` coordinates.",
);

=item * textfont

Sets the text font.

=cut

has textfont => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Sets the text font.",
);

=item * textposition

Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects to the (x,y) coordinates.

=cut

has textposition => (
    is => 'rw',
    documentation => "Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects to the (x,y) coordinates.",
);

=item * name

Sets the trace name

=cut

has name => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the trace name",
);

=pod

=back

=cut


=head2 type

Trace type.

=cut

sub type {
	my @components = split(/::/, __PACKAGE__);
	return lc($components[-1]);
}
